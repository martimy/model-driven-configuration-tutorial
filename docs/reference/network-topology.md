# Network Topology

This tutorial is based on a simple three-node multi-vendor network arranged in a ring topology. The three routers are connected to management network named `api-lab` using the IPv4 subnet `192.168.100.0/24`.

Node | Model | Management IP
:---:|---|---
ceos-01 | Arista cEOS | 192.168.100.11
srl-01  | Nokia SR Linux node | 192.168.100.12
srl-02  | Nokia SR Linux node | 192.168.100.13
